# apache-log-parser

A microservice based full stack application to parse Apache Common Log files and aggregate the data for display in charts and tables.
Built using Next.js, Go, and PostgreSQL.

The goal is to deploy to AWS ECS.

#### Running

`docker compose up`

An example Apache log can be generated by following the default instructions from [this](https://github.com/mingrammer/flog) log generator.
Which can then be uploaded to the backend to be parsed and stored either from the frontend or just with an http client like Postman.

Ports:

- web: `3000`
- database (**PostreSQL**): `5432`
- parser service: `4000`
- data retrieval service: `4001`
